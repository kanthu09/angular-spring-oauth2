# AngularJS + Spring MVC + Spring Security OAuth 2.0

This is a template/example project to demonstrate a simplified use of OAuth in a REST based application.

Features I was aiming at were:

* single application
* no application authorization required
* application specific user storage
* hiding all the security aspects from common service and application developer
